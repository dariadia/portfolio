An educational project for one of my tutees, this is a sample banking dashboard. One can: add, edit, and delete transactions. The info box above recalculates the totals after any transaction is moved to another status. 

This app was built for purely educational purposes. First, to teach my tutee about implementing the drag and drop mechanic. Second, to cater for their immediate needs.

My tutee works for as a backend developer for a company with no visual dashboard to monitor their transactions. The app needed to be as simple as possible to show the managers the total counts and the overall situation. Simple and available at a glance.
