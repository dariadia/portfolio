An RPG game about ghost-adventures in an old library. Runs on JS and canvas technologies. 

User can explore the locations, talk to the NPC ghosts and solve the murder mystery before it's too late (if user fails to collect the clues before morning, they get killed by the same force that did in everyone else).
